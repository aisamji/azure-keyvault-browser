#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
#.idea/

# Add Cargo.lock to gitignore (i.e. do not commit) if building a library-only project.
# If building a binary/executable, leave it commented (i.e. commit Cargo.lock to git).
# Cargo.lock

# The xtask/Cargo.lock should always be committed, even if the root Cargo.lock is gitignored.
# xtask contains build commands to help with developer tooling and is not deployed to the enduser.
